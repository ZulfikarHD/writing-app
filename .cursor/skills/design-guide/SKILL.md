# Overview

- App Design is clean and compact app 
- Always think hirarchy for mobile user prespective in user experience when designing the pages
- use motion-v
- always run yarn run build in the end
- use the components that already created if it not to complex, i have forms,badges.button,model/dialog/alert component.
### Use iOS Design Principles like
- **Spring Physics**: Natural, bouncy animations that feels like native iOS
- **Press Feedback**: Scale-down effect when element is tapped (0.97 scale)
- **Glass Effect**: Frosted glass navbar and footer with backdrop blur
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration API for tactile response
- **Staggered Animations**: Sequential entrance animations for lists
- **Gesture Recognition**: Swipe-to-delete, pull-to-refresh, drag-to-dismiss
